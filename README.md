### 🚀 About Me

I am a **Software Engineer** with **4+ years of experience**, currently leading the development team at **CANDO**. My expertise lies at the intersection of **High-Performance Backend Architecture**, **Cloud Infrastructure**, and **Data Engineering**.

I specialize in building scalable REST services, orchestrating complex ETL pipelines, and integrating AI models into production environments. I am passionate about applying **DevOps philosophies** and **Clean Architecture** patterns (Factory, Repository) to solve real-world business problems.

### 🛠️ Technical Arsenal

| Domain | Stack & Tools | 
 | ----- | ----- | 
| **Backend Architecture** | Python (FastAPI, Flask), SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Gunicorn, Design Patterns | 
| **Cloud & DevOps** | AWS (EC2, S3, Cognito), Docker, Nginx, Bash Scripting, CI/CD, RabbitMQ, Celery | 
| **Data & AI** | PostgreSQL (pgvector), dbt, OpenAI API, Pandas, NumPy, Metabase, ETL Pipelines | 
| **Frontend & Testing** | React, TypeScript, Pytest (Factories, Integration), Jest, Alembic | 

### 🏆 Featured Engineering Projects

#### 1. [AI-Powered Recruitment Orchestration API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11900697/2sAYQfEVKg)

> *End-to-end recruitment ecosystem handling vacancy creation, OCR, and background checks.*

* **The Scope:** Centralized workflow for leading staffing agencies, unifying psychometrics, background screening, and digital contracts into a single API.

* **Performance:** Optimizing heavy AI/OCR endpoints to service **100+ concurrent users** with sub-5s response times.

* **Tech Stack:** Flask, Pydantic, Tesseract OCR, Docker, Nginx.

#### 2. [Vector-Optimized AI Recommendation Engine](https://www.briam.dev/work/ai-powered-candidate-and-vacancy-recommendation-system)

> *High-performance matching system leveraging PostgreSQL Vector extension and OpenAI Embeddings.*

* **The Challenge:** Solving the "noise" problem in mass recruitment to filter thousands of candidates instantly.

* **The Solution:** Architected a system shifting heavy Cosine Similarity math from Python to the Database layer using **pgvector**.

* **Impact:** Achieved a **400% increase in calculation speed**, enabling analysts to shortlist candidates **10x faster** with **88% semantic accuracy** (AUC).

#### 3. [Self-Hosted Enterprise Analytics Platform](https://www.briam.dev/work/self-hosted-enterprise-analytics-platform)

> *Zero-Downtime ELT ecosystem deployed on AWS.*

* **Reliability:** Implemented a **"Blue/Green" Schema Swapping strategy** in Bash/SQL to ensure 24/7 dashboard availability during data refreshes.

* **Infrastructure:** Fully containerized on **AWS EC2** with persistent EBS storage, featuring automated SSL (Let's Encrypt) and dynamic FDW configuration.

* **Stack:** PostgreSQL 16, dbt (ephemeral runners), Metabase, Docker Compose.

#### 4. [Declarative Data Cleaning Library](https://www.briam.dev/work/python-data-cleaning-library)

> *Configuration-driven preprocessing engine for Data Science pipelines.*

* **Innovation:** A Python library that decouples cleaning logic from execution using **YAML configuration files**, ensuring reproducibility.

* **Features:** Automated outlier detection (Z-Score/IQR), smart missing data imputation, and type enforcement, reducing boilerplate code.

### 💼 Professional Experience

**Backend Lead @ CANDO** *(04/2024 - Present)*

* Leading the engineering team and defining technical roadmap.

* Designing scalable REST architectures using **FastAPI** and **Factory patterns**.

* Implemented a centralized authentication system using **AWS Cognito** as the single source of truth for role-based access control (RBAC).

* Architected asynchronous processing workflows for heavy tasks using **RabbitMQ** and **Celery**.

**Software Developer @ Fluid Attacks** *(06/2022 - 03/2024)*

* Contributed to the core web product using **ReactJS** and **TypeScript**.

* Enhanced system reliability through rigorous testing implementation (Pytest, Jest) and SCA vulnerability scanning.

**Data Developer/Analyst @ Fluid Attacks** *(03/2021 - 06/2022)*

* Design and creation of metrics from external data sources using Grow tool for data transformation (PostgreSQL, dbt,
Amazon Redshift).

* Retrieving and transforming information from large datasets.

### 💡 Philosophy & Interests

I thrive in environments where **Technical Excellence** meets **Business Value**.

* **Data-Driven:** I believe in making decisions based on metrics, from code performance to product KPIs.

* **Automation First:** If I have to do it twice, I script it.

* **Open Source:** Leveraging powerful tools like `dbt`, `pgvector`, and `FastAPI` to build enterprise-grade solutions.

*Let's build something scalable.* 🚀
